# 🔍 Anomaly Detection in Transactions

A machine learning project designed to identify unusual, suspicious, or fraudulent transaction patterns from financial data.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in transaction data using statistical and machine learning techniques. By learning normal transaction behavior, the system flags irregular activities that may indicate fraud, errors, or security threats.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of historical transaction records with features such as:

* Transaction Amount
* Transaction Time
* Account / User ID
* Merchant Category
* Location
* Transaction Frequency

## 🧠 Models & Techniques

* Isolation Forest

These models help identify outliers without relying on labeled data.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* ROC-AUC

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iam-huzaifa/Anomaly_Detection_In_Transations.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Anomaly_Detection_In_Transactions
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the notebook or script to detect anomalies in transaction data.

## 📈 Results

The system effectively detects abnormal transactions and highlights potential fraud cases, improving transaction monitoring and risk management.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Real-time anomaly detection
* Deep learning models (Autoencoders)
* Model deployment using Flask or FastAPI
* Integration with live transaction systems
